One operating system function is that of the processor manager. 
According to John Philips Jones, "it is responsable for allocating processing time to the various processes that can run on an operating system".
The processor manager is also associated with the CPU. 
Together, the processor manager and the memory manager have a form of cooperation, much like other operating system functions.
